Imtiaz Ali's Jab We Met is one of the most refreshing love stories made in recent times. It is a very simple, interesting and charming film about a heart-broken and serious guy who meets an extremely vivacious and talkative girl who gradually manages to change his perception of life and love. And then, the story turns over in a rather interesting way. The film works better in the first half, as it is more alluring and funny. It later turns into a mini-drama but still in a natural way with a lot of comedy and fun. The music is great and each song contributes to the film's mood in its own way. The film stars Shahid Kapoor in a greatly restrained and impressive act as Aditya, but it is Kareena Kapoor's film all the way. Her comic timing is top-notch, and she is charming, convincing and full of life as the unforgettable Geet. Later on she also provides some superbly acted dramatic scenes, which she plays with unusual restraint and depth. Jab We Met is a very memorable picture, extremely entertaining and uplifting, and definitely a must-see for those who enjoy pleasant, comic and romantic flicks.
